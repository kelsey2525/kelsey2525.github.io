A rolling D20 dice simulation with a retro CRT-style shader effect. Features include:

Pixelation & CRT Shader: Adds scanlines, bloom, and curvature for an old-school display look.
Realistic Physics: Dice rolls with damping, bouncing, and gravity for smooth motion.
Face Detection & Flashing: Highlights the face that lands upright.
Dynamic Labels: Numbered faces update visibility based on camera angle.
Built with Three.js, using custom shaders for pixelation and CRT effects.
