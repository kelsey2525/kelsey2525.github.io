On page entry:
- clip-path focuses on the shoe and expands out to reveal the whole image.
- The image starts at scale: 1.5 and shrinks down to scale: 1.
- Top text and the magnifying glass icon at the bottom revealed.

Hovering on the card enlarges the magnifying glass by scaling up.
The magnifying glass is clip-path on a larger image in the element and follows the cursor 'magnifying' the smaller image beneath it.
A bit of animation on page entry just adds a bit of style
