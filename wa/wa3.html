    <p><i>The Greatest Showman</i> is a 2017 American biographical musical drama film directed by Michael Gracey from a screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon, based on an original story by Bicks. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya. Featuring nine original songs written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, and an original musical orchestral score composed by John Debney and Joseph Trapanese, the film is a heavily fictionalized depiction of the life of P. T. Barnum, a showman and entertainer who created the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and its star attractions.

    <p><i>The Greatest Showman</i> premiered on December 8, 2017, aboard the RMS Queen Mary 2 in New York City and was released in the United States on December 20, by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances, music, visuals, and production values, but criticised its artistic license and overdramatic story. It still was a box-office success, grossing $459 million worldwide against a $84 million budget. The film received nominations for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actor – Musical or Comedy for Jackman at the 75th Golden Globe Awards. <i>The Greatest Showman</i> won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for "This Is Me", which was also nominated for Best Original Song at the 90th Academy Awards, and won Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. A stage musical adaptation is in development from the Disney Theatrical Group following their parent company's acquisition of the film and the Fox assets in 2019.</p>

<p>
In the 19th century, young P. T. Barnum and his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. Barnum falls for their daughter, Charity.</p>

<p>When Charity attends finishing school, she and Barnum write to each other until reuniting as adults ("A Million Dreams"). They eventually marry and raise two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City. They live a humble life, and though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more ("A Million Dreams (Reprise)").</p>

<p>Barnum loses his shipping clerk job when the company goes bankrupt, due to a typhoon that sank all the firm's cargo vessels. He later secures a bank loan, deceptively using his former employer's lost ships as "collateral". He opens Barnum's American Museum in downtown Manhattan which features various wax figures.</p>

<p>Ticket sales are slow, so Caroline and Helen suggest showcasing something "alive". Barnum adds "freak" performers, such as bearded lady Lettie Lutz and dwarf man Charles Stratton ("Come Alive"). This garners higher attendance, but also protests and poor reviews from well-known critic James Gordon Bennett.</p>

<p>Barnum renames his venture "Barnum's Circus" and recruits playwright Phillip Carlyle to help generate publicity ("The Other Side"). Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist, Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Barnum persuades famed Swedish singer Jenny Lind to tour America, with him as her manager. Lind's American debut is a success ("Never Enough"). During her song, Phillip's parents see him and Anne holding hands and he quickly lets go. As Barnum gains favor with aristocratic patrons, he distances himself from his troupe, advising them to work without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their harassers ("This Is Me").</p>

<p>When Phillip and Anne attend the theater together, they run into Phillip's parents. They chastise him for "parading around with the help." Phillip tries to convince Anne that they can be together, but she disagrees, saying they will never be accepted socially ("Rewrite the Stars").</p>

<p>As Barnum takes Lind on a U.S. tour, Charity, who stays home with the girls, feels isolated from her husband ("Tightrope"). While on tour, Lind becomes romantically attracted to Barnum. When he rejects her advances, she threatens to quit and later retaliates with a kiss at the end of her last show ("Never Enough (Reprise)"), which is photographed by the press.</p>

<p>Barnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building to save Anne, not knowing that she has already escaped. He suffers serious injuries before Barnum rescues him.</p>

<p>Bennett tells Barnum that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has cancelled her tour after Barnum's "scandal". Barnum's mansion is foreclosed, and Charity (having found out about the kiss) berates Barnum for his obsessions. She takes their daughters to her parents' home.</p>

<p>Devastated, Barnum retreats to a local bar. His troupe finds him there and say that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family. Inspired, he resolves to build a new show and not let ambition blind him ("From Now On"). Phillip awakens in a hospital with Anne by his side, while Barnum and Charity reconcile.</p>

<p>A recovering Phillip offers his share of the profits to help Barnum rebuild the circus in exchange for becoming a full partner, which Barnum readily accepts. To economize, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus.</p>

<p>The revamped circus is a huge success ("The Greatest Show"). Barnum has Phillip take his place as the ringmaster so Barnum can spend more time with his family. Barnum leaves the circus early on an African bush elephant to attend Caroline and Helen's ballet recital.

<h3>Development</h3>
During rehearsals for the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, producers Laurence Mark and Bill Condon compared host Jackman to Barnum. After Jackman expressed interest in a Barnum project, Mark and Condon approached Jenny Bicks, a writer for the ceremony. She and Condon wrote <i>The Greatest Showman</i>. The project was first announced in 2009, with Jackman already set for the title role. In August 2011, Michael Gracey was chosen to direct. In 2013, Fox hired songwriting team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul to write the songs.

In early 2016, the cast performed a read-through in front of producers to green-light the film. Pasek and Paul approached Jeremy Jordan to sing the part of Carlyle, since Jordan recorded demos for the film in 2015. The day before the read-through, Jackman underwent nasal surgery and was ordered by his doctor not to sing. Pasek and Paul asked Jordan to also sing the part of Barnum while Jackman acted out the scenes, to which Jordan agreed. While the cast performed "From Now On", Jackman disobeyed orders and began singing along with Jordan. This brought the read-through to an emotional end, which resulted in the film being greenlit.

On June 15, 2016, Zac Efron began negotiations to star in the film, and in July 2016, Michelle Williams was cast. The film was choreographed by Ashley Wallen.

<h3>Filming</h3>
The film took seven years to produce, and Jackman had ten weeks of preparation before filming started. Rehearsals on the film began in October 2016 in New York City, and principal photography began on November 22, 2016.

<h3>Post-production</h3>
In December 2017, it was reported that James Mangold, who had worked with Jackman on several projects (including 2017's Logan), had been brought in to serve as an executive producer during the film's post-production. In an interview, director Michael Gracey noted, "There were eight producers on this film, and it was amazing having one of them be a filmmaker."
